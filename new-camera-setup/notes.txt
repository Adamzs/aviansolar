The new v2 camera setup involves using docker to mount the drive and then a systemd service to start the recording at boot

(For reference, here is the guide I used to create a systemd service: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/start-service-at-boot/)

First need to configure a docker volume for the network drive on the pi.  Run:
docker volume create --driver local --opt type=nfs --opt o=addr=10.0.0.86 --opt device=:/media/usb mynfs
Also create the directory to mount on. Run:
mkdir /data/mount/nfs

Now when we start our docker container we can tell it to mount "mynfs"

Next we have to build the docker container for mounting the drive.  In the repo there is a directory aviansolar/new-camera-setup/drive-mount, copy that to: /data/bai-edge-sdk/
then run the build-docker.sh file in there.  That will create a container named "drive-mount".

The file test_service.sh is what we will run on boot using systemd.  In that file we start the docker container with mynfs and then start the gstreamer utility.

Copy the file aviansolar/new-camera-setup/test_service.sh to /usr/bin/ and make sure it is executable (chmod a+x)

Create the boot counter file. Create a file named bcount.txt in the /data directory and put a 0 in it:
touch /data/bcount.txt
echo 0 > /data/bcount.txt

Copy the file aviansolar/new-camera-setup/myservice.service to /etc/systemd/system
cp myservice.service /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service
chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service

Then enable the service:
systemctl enable myservice


This is the contents of myservice.service for reference:
