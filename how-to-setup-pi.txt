First burn a raspberry pi ubuntu image to an sd card using the imager program.  I chose a 64 bit server version.

Then set it up so it auto-mounts an external NTFS drive.  Follow these instructions: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/41959/automount-various-usb-stick-file-systems-on-jessie-lite
-- leave out the fsblk stuff in both sections
-- remove sync from ___
-- I had to do the stuff at the bottom with usbmount.rules

Then set up an NFS server following these instructions: https://www.tecmint.com/install-nfs-server-on-ubuntu/
-- the directory i shared was /media/usb
-- I put 10.0.0.0/24 for the subnet access
-- I added no_root_squash to the options
-- skip the firewall section (we don't have a firewall enabled)

Then set up a dhcp server on the pi
Make the pi have a static ip on eth0: https://www.tecmint.com/configure-network-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu/
this is what I added to the file /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: no
            dhcp6: no
            addresses: [10.0.0.86/24]
            gateway4: 10.0.0.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]
    version: 2

Follow these instructions:
https://www.tecmint.com/install-dhcp-server-in-ubuntu-debian/

-- added 
INTERFACESv4="eth0"
INTERFACESv6="eth0"
to /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

-- added these entries to /etc/dhcpd.conf
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   option routers 10.0.0.1;
   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
   range dynamic-bootp 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.254;
}

-- Set up dhcp to tell it to assign 10.0.0.86 to the pi - not sure this step is necessary since we gave it a static ip above
-- note the mac address will need to be updated here with the mac addres of the eth0 port on the pi
host ubuntu-node {
   hardware ethernet dc:a6:32:50:c3:51;
   fixed-address 10.0.0.86;
}




On the DNNCam edit the file in ___ to have the mount command at the start:
sudo mount 10.0.0.86:/media/usb /media


sudo nmcli radio wifi on
or off
sudo nmtui
