Upload new set of videos: Use Globus
1. Install globus connect personal on your computer: https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal (make sure to share the directory of the video files you want to transfer)
2. To to https://www.globus.org and Log In - choose Argonne National Laboratory for "existing organizational login"
3. After logged in make sure you are on "File Manager" section
4. On left side of screen click on Search and type lcrc - Select lcrc#dtn_bebop
5. This will have you log in to lcrc (I think)
6. Once you are logged in in the Path box on the LCRC DTN side type: /lcrc/project/aviansolar
7. Double click on avian-solar-data and then double click on videos folder
8. Create a new folder using the format year-month-day
9. On the right side of the screen open the directory on your local computer where the videos files are
10. Select the camera directories you want to transfer on the right side (like dnncam1 and dnncam2) and then Start at the bottom
This will start the transfer in the background and could take some time.  To check on progress click the "ACTIVITY" icon on the left side menu bar.

After videos are uploaded, here is what to do to process them:
1. Go to the day directory of the new data, for example /lcrc/project/aviansolar/avian-solar-data/videos/2020-05-13-bldg-372
2. Create the files_list.csv file in there (See HOWTO Step 2 below)
3. Create the collection of sbatch files.  Currently LCRC limits us to 100 parallel jobs in the queue at a time, so you needs an sbatch file for every 100 videos.  (so if we have 223 videos you will need 3 sbatch files, 1 for 1-100, 1 for 101-200, and 1 for 201-223) (See HOWTO Step 3 below)
4. Go to the video_processing directory of aviansolar code directory: this is at /lcrc/project/aviansolar/aviansolar/video_processing
5. Execute each sbatch file one at a time, waiting for the prior to complete (See HOWTO Step 5 below)

HOWTO Step 2:
1. Go to the /lcrc/project/aviansolar/avian-solar-data/videos directory
2. If we are using as an example, run this command: find 2020-05-13-bldg-372/ -mindepth 2 -type f -name *.mkv > 2020-05-13-bldg-372/files_list.csv
3. Download the 2020-05-13-bldg-372/file_list.csv file to your computer
4. Open it in excel
5. Add a column to the left side and in that column create an incrementing index for every row with a filename (starting the index at 1)
6. Add a header row: "Index, Directory"
7. Upload the file back to the 2020-05-13-bldg-372 directory
(NOTE: a python script could be written to create this file that would avoid all these steps, but I haven't gotten around to it yet)

HOWTO Step 3:
1. Copy the sbatch file from an existing directory and modify it for the new one
2. Run: cp 2019-06-26-bldg-372/vidprocess_array_files1.sbatch 2020-05-13-bldg-372/.
3. Modify 2 things in the file:
a. The line: #SBATCH --array=1-100
The 1-100 needs to be changed to what you have.  Assuming you have more than 223 videos in your files_list.csv the first one will be 1-100, and the second will be 101-200, and the third will be 201-223
b. The python execution line at the bottom will need the directory of the files_list.csv file update.  Just replace 2019-06-26-bldg-372 with 2020-05-13-bldg-372

HOWTO Step 5:
1. In the video_processing directory run:
sbatch /lcrc/project/aviansolar/avian-solar-data/videos/2020-05-13-bldg-372/vidprocess_array_files.sbatch
2. Check to see if the jobs are running with:
squeue --user <username>



After video is processed:
1. Make annotations.csv file for each day and camera directory (eg 2019-06-26-bldg-372/dnncam2/) (See HOWTO Step 1 below)
2. Copy over to public_html directory (See HOWTO Step 2 below)


HOWTO Step 1:
1. Go to "image_data" directory
2. Find day of data that was process, for example 2019-06-21-bldg-372, and go to that directory
3. Go into one of the camera directories, in our example go to dnncam1
4. Run this command: find . -mindepth 2 -type d > annotations.csv
This will create the annotations.csv file that will be used for annotating.
5. Add this text to the first line of the file: "directory,bird,cable,panel,plant,car,human,other animal,insect,aircraft,other,unknown,fly over above,fly over reflection,fly through,perch on panel,land on ground,perch in background,collision"
You can either use a text editor like nano or vi to paste it in, or you can use sed from the command line like this:
sed -i '1idirectory,bird,cable,panel,plant,car,human,other animal,insect,aircraft,other,unknown,fly over above,fly over reflection,fly through,perch on panel,land on ground,perch in background,collision' annotations.csv
6. Sort the rows with this command into a new file annotations2.csv: (head -n 1 annotations.csv && tail -n +2 annotations.csv | sort) > annotations2.csv
7. Then run this to replace annotations.csv with annotations2.csv: mv annotations2.csv annotations.csv

HOWTO Step 2:
1. First create the date directory in public_html if it doesn't already exist, in our example: 
mkdir /lcrc/project/aviansolar/public_html/2019-06-21-bldg-372
2. Then recursively copy the camera directory over, in our example: 
cp -r /lcrc/project/aviansolar/avian-solar-data/image_data/2019-06-21-bldg-372/dnncam1 /lcrc/project/aviansolar/public_html/2019-06-21-bldg-372/.
3. Set the permissions on the copied directory to public: 
chmod -R 755 /lcrc/project/aviansolar/public_html/2019-06-21-bldg-372/dnncam1
