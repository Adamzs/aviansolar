1. Setup DNNCam
a. set correct focus, zoom, iris
b. set up to record video on startup to network drive

2. Setup Raspberry Pi
a. burn raspberry pi os to micro sd card (32Gb cards)
b. configure to auto-mount usb drive
b. configure to share network drive
c. set up dhcp server
d. configure static ip



1.a.
Place DNNCam in a location where there is a large area to focus on (things both far away and close up). 
Hook up the DNNCam to a wired network that supports DHCP. (I do this from my home network because Argonne's network is not good with this)  
Figure out the IP address assigned to the camera and then SSH into it in 2 terminals.  (username: boulderai, password: baidnncam)  
In one terminal run command:
/home/boulderai/webcameratester/direct_streamer "nvarguscamerasrc ! video/x-raw(memory:NVMM), width=3840, height=2160, format=(string)NV12, framerate=60/1 ! nvvidconv ! video/x-raw, width=(int)3840, height=(int)2160, format=(string)NV12 ! omxh265enc preset-level=3 bitrate=12000000  ! rtph265pay name=pay0 pt=96"

On desktop open VLC media player and select Media->Open Network Stream.
Enter: rtsp://10.0.0.4:8554/test (changing the ip address to the ip address of the DNNCam)

In the other terminal window that is sshed into the dnncam go to the webcameratester folder.
Use the lensDriver utility to adjust the focus, iris and zoom to make the video stream in VLC media player look clear
sudo ./lensDriver
focusup 10 or focusdown 10
zoomup 10 or zoomdown 10

Currently there is no systematic way to get good settings for this.  

zoomup as far as you can go then back down 200
focusdown a lot to focus
irisup as far as you can go (which is opening up the iris) - then go down until brightness is normal



1.b.
SSH in to dnncam
In home directory clone the git repo: git clone https://github.com/Adamzs/aviansolar.git
cd to the aviansolar/camera_files directory
Do what it says to do in the README.md file


2.a.
Download the raspberry pi imager utility from: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
Run it and click the "CHOOSE OS" button
Select Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS - 64-bit server OS for arm64 architectures
Then choose the SD card to write to
Then click WRITE

When finished remove micro sd card from computer and put into raspberry pi
Connect the pi to a wired network connection and power on
Find out ip of pi and ssh into it - username: ubuntu, password: ubuntu
You will be prompted to change the password, set it to: aviansolar

2.b-d.
